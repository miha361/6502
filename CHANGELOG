working again!


feb '13:


/* the whole cpu and parts of the system are covered by this datatype.
 * this allows to create virtual systems with more than one cpu. a kind
 * of more or less SMP could be possible. i think of a RTOS running on a
 * fast ARM-chip.
 * we also hold the whole instruction set in this datatype, so we can
 * change opcodes on one and the other cpu remains unaffected. this can
 * be quite cool if we would emulate a 2-CPU-system with a 65c02 and a xxxxxx
 * with a little changed instruction set. 
 *
 * however, this is only the datatype for handling a cpu. the emu that
 * uses this untested black magic still has to be written.
 *
 * these things are implemented yet or will be soon:
 *
 *   + cpu (registers, irq/nmi/reset callback functions)
 *   + memory image
 *   + memory mapped I/O samples: simple rng, timer (not working right now)
 *   - frequency setting
 *
 *
 * of course, this needs a large amount of memory. at the moment each cpu 
 * consumes about 68k of ram.
 *
